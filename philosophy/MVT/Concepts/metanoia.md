## Etymology

**Origins**: The term "metanoia" is derived from the Greek word Î¼ÎµÏ„Î¬Î½Î¿Î¹Î±, composed of "meta-" (meaning "beyond" or "after") and "noia" (derived from "nous," meaning "mind" or "thought"). Thus, metanoia literally means "a change of mind" or "beyond thinking."

In early Christian texts, metanoia was used to translate the Hebrew concept of "teshuva," which means repentance and returning to God. Over time, the term has been adopted in various contexts to describe significant and transformative changes in an individual's mindset or way of life.

Metanoia underscores the potential for personal and spiritual growth through profound reflection and transformation. It highlights the human capacity for change and the ongoing journey towards deeper understanding and self-improvement.
