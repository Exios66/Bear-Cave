# Cognitive Dissonance

*(ˈkäg-nə-tiv ˈdi-sə-nəns)*

## Noun

### Psychological Context
**Definition**: A mental discomfort experienced by a person who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values simultaneously. This discomfort often leads to an alteration in one of the conflicting beliefs or behaviors to reduce the dissonance and restore mental harmony.
**Example**: "Cognitive dissonance occurs when someone who values health continues to smoke, leading them to either rationalize the behavior or attempt to quit."

### Behavioral Context
**Definition**: The phenomenon where an individual's actions are inconsistent with their beliefs or values, creating internal conflict and prompting a change in attitudes or behaviors to align with each other.
**Example**: "After buying an expensive car, the buyer experienced cognitive dissonance about the purchase and began justifying the decision by emphasizing the car's benefits."

### Sociological Context
**Definition**: The collective experience of cognitive dissonance within a group when shared beliefs or norms are challenged by new information or differing perspectives, often leading to a shift in group attitudes or behaviors.
**Example**: "When new evidence about climate change emerged, the community faced cognitive dissonance as it conflicted with their long-held beliefs about environmental practices."

## Etymology
**Origins**: The term "cognitive dissonance" was coined by the American psychologist Leon Festinger in 1957. It combines "cognitive," relating to mental processes, with "dissonance," which refers to a lack of harmony or agreement. Festinger's theory arose from his studies on how people strive for internal consistency and how they cope with the discomfort of conflicting cognitions.

Cognitive dissonance theory has become a foundational concept in psychology, explaining a wide range of behaviors and attitudes. It highlights the lengths to which individuals will go to achieve mental consistency, including changing beliefs, acquiring new information, or minimizing the importance of conflicting cognitions. This concept is widely used to understand decision-making processes, attitude change, and the mechanisms of self-justification.
