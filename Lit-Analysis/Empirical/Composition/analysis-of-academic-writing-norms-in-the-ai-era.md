## |SECTION -> 1|

In this Abstract, Friederich and Symons succinctly present the key theme of their paper. They acknowledge the rapid advancements in AI technology and its increasing use in academic contexts. The authors express concern about the potential consequences of AI applications in academic writing and publishing, particularly how they might disrupt established norms and ethical standards.

1. **The AI Challenge in Academia**: The Abstract begins by highlighting how advanced AI tools, like text-generating models, have become increasingly sophisticated. These tools can now produce complex, high-quality academic texts, posing new challenges for traditional academic practices.

2. **Concerns of Misuse and Ethical Implications**: The authors raise concerns about the potential misuse of AI in academic writing. This misuse could include passing off AI-generated content as solely human work, which raises ethical issues around originality, authorship, and academic integrity.

3. **The Need for New Norms**: Recognizing these challenges, the Abstract argues for the need to develop new norms and standards for academic writing in the AI era. This is not just about regulating AI use but also about adapting to a changing landscape where the lines between human and machine contributions become blurred.

4. **Proposed System of Norms**: The key proposal in the Abstract is the introduction of a novel system of norms. This system would include, among other things, a mandatory documentary statement in academic papers. This statement would detail the extent and nature of AI contributions to the research and writing process. The idea is to ensure transparency and maintain academic integrity while embracing the benefits of AI.

5. **Balancing Act**: The authors emphasize the need to balance the potential benefits of AI in academic writing (such as efficiency and analytical capabilities) with ethical considerations and the maintenance of scholarly standards.

## |SECTION.2|

In Section 2, "Introduction," of "Norms for Academic Writing in the Era of Advanced Artificial Intelligence," Friederich and Symons elaborate on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in the realm of academic writing, assessment, reviewing, and publishing. They discuss the current capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and the anticipated development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), potentially surpassing human cognitive abilities in key aspects.

Key points in this section include:

    1. Impact of AI on Academic Practices: The authors explore the implications of advanced AI on the social organization of science, including academic writing and publishing. They highlight the increased sophistication of AI systems, raising questions about their role and acknowledgment in academic work.

    2. Transformation of Academic Research and Publishing: There's a focus on how AI, particularly LLMs and future AGI systems, could transform academic research and publishing processes. The authors note that some academic journals have already begun adjusting their guidelines to account for AI contributions.

    3. Challenges and Opportunities of AI: The introduction discusses both the challenges (such as potential misuse of AI in academia) and the opportunities (like AI's potential to enhance analytical rigor and originality in research) that advanced AI systems bring to the academic field.

    4. Future of Academic Publishing: The authors ponder a future where AI systems might take over the knowledge production process, potentially leading to significant changes in the function and format of academic publishing.

    5. Structure of the Paper: The section also outlines the structure of the rest of the paper, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of proposed norms for academic writing and publishing in the age of AI.

This section serves to frame the issues at hand and provides a comprehensive background for the subsequent discussions and proposals presented in the paper. The authors effectively lay the groundwork for a nuanced conversation about integrating AI into academic practices while maintaining the principles of academic integrity and progress.

## |SECTION.3|

In Section 3, "Some Desiderata for Norms of Academic Writing and Publishing," Friederich and Symons emphasize the essential attributes for future academic norms in the context of advanced AI. They highlight four key principles: fairness, harm prevention, novelty, and practicality. Here's an in-depth analysis of each desideratum:

    1. Adequate Attribution: The norms should prevent individuals from taking credit for achievements actually made by AI systems. This contributes to fairness and prevents harm from dishonesty. It also aligns with the value of academic progress, as accurate attribution ensures more skilled individuals receive appropriate opportunities. Furthermore, it maintains contexts where humans can learn basic skills without AI assistance.

    2. Enable Novelty/Disincentivise Redundancy: The authors address the risk of AI-enhanced papers flooding academia with linguistically polished but conceptually weak content, potentially crowding out substantial human-generated work. This desideratum aims to foster novelty and quality in academic output. It balances the need for advanced AI systems, which could contribute to novel results, against the danger of encouraging low-quality AI-assisted work.

    3. Prevent Harm: This desideratum focuses on minimizing harm from AI use in academia. It highlights two types of harm: replicating existing biases and generating persuasive but inaccurate information. The authors emphasize the need for academic publishing norms to close "responsibility gaps" related to AI use, ensuring accountability for any harm caused by AI in academia. They also discuss the risks of differential access to AI systems and the potential impact on academic freedom.

    4. Good as Norms: The new norms must be adoptable and enforceable within the academic community. They should align with existing academic values, be simple enough to understand and remember, and be enforceable with detectable violations and appropriate sanctions. The authors stress the importance of social consensus and the legitimacy of the actors promoting the norms for their adoption and internalization.

Each of these desiderata addresses a specific aspect of the complex relationship between AI and academic writing and publishing. The authors advocate for a thoughtful and balanced approach to developing new norms that can adapt to the evolving role of AI in academia, ensuring integrity, fairness, and progress in academic work.
